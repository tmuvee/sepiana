## AtelierDemo.json

'Atelier' is the default/demo level and the example has few dashboards with Home Assistant originated CPU and memory data. You must change the Home Assistant connection parameters to make it work with your Home Assistant server. 

## Gauges folder

This folder contains .png files for the dial faces, but also .afdesign (Affinity Designer) and .svg files, so that you can easily create your own images.
